# Winter Workshop on Image Processing
This is a collection of codes and test images for learning opencv. Most of the codes here have been written at the Winter Workshop on Image Processing at IIT Kgp.
## How to compile and run the code
Open the terminal and go to the directory containing the file you want to compile. If the filename is `first.cpp`, then execute the command `make first`.
This will create a binary file which can be run by the command `./first`.
